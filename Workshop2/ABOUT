PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

[This Python script is customized for GAP products] 
First, the web scraper asks the user for the number of clothing pieces that he/she is considering purchasing
For each url link, the script will scrape information and calculate the water footprint based on materials/clothing type
GOAL: display which choice is more environmentally friendly (the lower the score, the more eco-friendly)
